              Automatic discovery of RFC 5626 Edge Proxies
              draft-procter-dispatch-outbound-discovery-01

Abstract

   [RFC5626] (commonly known as 'SIP outbound') defines mechanisms that
   permit SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) UAs (User Agents) to
   maintain multiple connections to a registrar or proxy via multiple
   Edge Proxies, known as the outbound-proxy-set.  Discovering the URIs
   that make up the outbound-proxy-set is left to configuration or
   future discovery mechanisms.  This draft defines a simple discovery
   mechanism that enables UAs to discover the URIs of all the Edge
   Proxies in the outbound-proxy-set without requiring additional
   configuration on the UA.

1.  Introduction

   Reliably maintaining connectivity between a SIP UA and a registrar
   across the Internet, in the presence of NATs, routing changes, and
   maintenance of intervening equipment is made more straightforward by
   [RFC5626].  The mechanisms in that specification allow multiple
   connections over diverse routes, equipment, and data centres, which
   permit a more robust SIP service to be created.

   However, one of the hurdles that is preventing wide-spread use of
   these mechanisms is discovering the outbound-proxy-set, the list of
   suitable edge proxies that a UA may use for multiple connections.
   Some UAs permit this set to be configured, but the large number of
   options available on many UAs means that configuration for robustness
   is often overlooked once basic operation is possible.

   This draft describes a simple mechanism by which a UA supporting
   [RFC5626] may determine the outbound-proxy-set from the DNS.

2.  User Agent Behaviour

2.1.  Determining the outbound-proxy-set

   The UA, preparing to register with a domain, gathers all edge proxies
   named in the DNS SRV records associated with that domain, and uses
   them to populate the outbound-proxy-set.

   The DNS SRV lookup will result in a set of targets and ports, along
   with weights and priorities.  For the purpose of determining the

   outbound-proxy-set, the weights and priorities are discarded.  The
   targets and ports are transformed into URIs by combining them with
   the scheme and protocol used in the the SRV query.

   TODO: We could use the SRV weights and priorities to map to q-values
   on the registered contacts, but I'm not convinced mapping inbound and
   outbound preferences together like this is necessarily helpful.

   For example, a DNS SRV query for '_sip._tcp.example.net' might result
   in the responses:

       SRV 0 5 5060 edge-01.example.net.
       SRV 0 5 5060 edge-02.example.net.
       SRV 5 0 5060 edge-fallback.example.net.

   These should be mapped to the following URIs, which will now form the
   outbound-proxy-set:

       sip:edge-01.example.net:5060;transport=tcp
       sip:edge-02.example.net:5060;transport=tcp
       sip:edge-fallback.example.net:5060;transport=tcp

   TODO: omit port if it is default for transport?  Need to specify at
   least one of port and transport to prevent another round of NAPTR
   lookups when the o-p-s is used for loose routing to the Edge Proxy.

   Following the construction of the outbound-proxy-set, the procedures
   in [RFC5626] section 4.2 may be followed to generate the initial
   registration via one of the proxies in the outbound-proxy-set.

   Provided the initial registration is successful, and the registrar
   supports [RFC5626] (as indicated by the presence of the outbound
   option-tag in the Require header field of a successful registration
   response), the UA can then create additional registrations to as many
   of the remaining proxies in the outbound-proxy-set as are supported.

   If the initial registration is successful, but the registrar does not
   support [RFC5626], then the UA cannot establish subsequent
   registrations.

   If the initial registration is unsuccessful for reasons of edge proxy
   failure or transaction timeout, then the UA may repeat the initial
   registration but with a different outbound proxy selected from the
   outbound-proxy-set.

2.2.  Maintaining the outbound-proxy-set

   Since the outbound-proxy-set is now determined dynamically, rather
   than through static configuration, care should be taken to respect
   the relevant DNS TTL values and ensure that when the DNS records
   change, the configuration of the outbound-proxy-set and the number
   and destinations of registrations are updated accordingly.

3.  Registrar considerations

   There are no changes needed for the correct operation of Registrars.

   If the system uses SRV-based load-balancing, and has a low-priority
   SRV record pointing to an edge proxy that is normally only used under
   fault conditions (sometimes known as a 'canary' proxy), then a UA
   using the approach described in this document might maintain
   registrations via this canary proxy which might be considered
   unexpected.  Such a system should not treat registration traffic via
   the canary proxy as indicative of a fault condition.

4.  Edge Proxy considerations

   There are no changes needed for the correct operation of Edge
   Proxies.

5.  Security Considerations

   TODO

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
