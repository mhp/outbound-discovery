              Automatic discovery of RFC 5626 Edge Proxies
              draft-procter-dispatch-outbound-discovery-00

Abstract

   [RFC5626] (commonly known as 'SIP outbound') defines mechanisms that
   permit SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) UAs (User Agents) to
   maintain multiple connections to a registrar or proxy via multiple
   Edge Proxies, known as the outbound-proxy-set.  Discovering the URIs
   that make up the outbound-proxy-set is left to configuration or
   future discovery mechanisms.  This draft defines a simple discovery
   mechanism that enables UAs to discover the URIs of all the Edge
   Proxies in the outbound-proxy-set without requiring additional
   configuration on the UA.

1.  Introduction

   Reliably maintaining connectivity between a SIP UA and a registrar
   across the Internet, in the presence of NATs, routing changes, and
   maintenance of intervening equipment is made more straightforward by
   [RFC5626].  The mechanisms in that specification allow multiple
   connections over diverse routes, equipment, and data centres, which
   permit a more robust SIP service to be created.

   However, one of the hurdles that is preventing wide-spread use of
   these mechanisms is discovering the outbound-proxy-set, the list of
   suitable edge proxies that a UA may use for multiple connections.
   Some UAs permit this set to be configured, but the large number of
   options available on many UAs means that configuration for robustness
   is often overlooked once basic operation is possible.

   This draft describes a simple mechanism by which a UA may advertise
   willingness to use the capabilities of [RFC5626] by determining the
   outbound-proxy-set from the DNS.  Should the registrar know that the
   outbound-proxy-set may be determined from the DNS, it can indicate
   such support in a successful response to a REGISTER request.  The UA,
   upon receiving that indication, may then determine the outbound-
   proxy-set and continue to register multiple flows as described in
   [RFC5626].

2.  User Agent Behaviour

2.1.  Advertising support

   A UA may register as normal, following the rules in section 4.2 of
   [RFC5626], but with an additional Supported option: obfromsrv.

      REGISTER sip:example.com SIP/2.0
      Via: SIP/2.0/TCP 192.0.2.2;branch=z9hG4bK-bad0ce-11-1036
      Max-Forwards: 70
      From: Bob <sip:bob@example.com>;tag=d879h76
      To: Bob <sip:bob@example.com>
      Call-ID: 8921348ju72je840.204
      CSeq: 1 REGISTER
      Supported: path, outbound, obfromsrv
      Contact: <sip:line1@192.0.2.2;transport=tcp>; reg-id=1;
       ;+sip.instance="<urn:uuid:00000000-0000-1000-8000-000A95A0E128>"
      Content-Length: 0

   The presence of this option indicates that the UA is willing to
   determine the outbound-proxy-set from the DNS as described later.
   The response from the registrar will indicate whether this action is
   to be taken or not.

2.2.  Determining the outbound-proxy-set

   If the successful response from the registrar includes the same
   option (obfromsrv), then the UA may gather all edge proxies named in
   the SRV records and use them to populate the outbound-proxy-set.

   The DNS SRV lookup will result in a set of targets and ports, along
   with weights and priorities.  For the purpose of determining the
   outbound-proxy-set, the weights and priorities are discarded.  The
   targets and ports are transformed into URIs by combining them with
   the scheme and protocol used in the the SRV query.

   TODO: We could use the SRV weights and priorities to map to q-values
   on the registered contacts, but I'm not convinced mapping inbound and
   outbound preferences together like this is necessarily helpful.

   For example, a DNS SRV query for '_sip._tcp.example.net' might result
   in the responses:

       SRV 0 5 5060 edge-01.example.net.
       SRV 0 5 5060 edge-02.example.net.
       SRV 5 0 5060 edge-fallback.example.net.

   These should be mapped to the following URIs, which will now form the
   outbound-proxy-set:

       sip:edge-01.example.net:5060;transport=tcp
       sip:edge-02.example.net:5060;transport=tcp
       sip:edge-fallback.example.net:5060;transport=tcp

   TODO: omit port if it is default for transport?  Need to specify at
   least one of port and transport to prevent another round of NAPTR
   lookups when the o-p-s is used for loose routing to the Edge Proxy.

   Following the construction of the outbound-proxy-set, the procedures
   in [RFC5626] section 4.2 may be followed.

2.3.  Maintaining the outbound-proxy-set

   Since the outbound-proxy-set is now determined dynamically, rather
   than through static configuration, care should be taken to respect
   the relevant DNS TTL values and ensure that when the DNS records
   change, the configuration of the outbound-proxy-set and the number
   and destinations of registrations are updated accordingly.

3.  Registrar behaviour

   For a registrar that already supports [RFC5626], there is only one
   change.  If the registrar is aware that the DNS records relating to
   it are suitably configured to be used in the way this document
   describes, and a UA attempting to register indicates support for
   these procedures, then it may signal acceptance by including the
   token 'obfromsrv' in the Supported header of the successful REGISTER
   response.

   The registrar is typically made aware of support for this feature
   through adminstrative means, such as a configuration change.  It
   might also be configured to only indicate support to a subset of UAs.

4.  Edge Proxy considerations

   There are no changes needed for the correct operation of Edge
   Proxies.

5.  Other approaches

   This section gives a brief overview of other possible approaches.  It
   can/will be deleted before publishing.

5.1.  Return O-P-S URIs in new header from registrar

   Add a new SIP header (e.g.  Outbound-URIs:) containing a list of SIP
   URIs to use as the outbound-proxy-set to the 200 response from the
   registrar to the UA.

   This will require changes to the registrar and UA only, assuming the
   edge proxies are transparent to the new header.  It is a very
   flexible arrangement, as the list can be dynamically generated on a
   per-UA basis if required, and not generated at all to permit a
   controlled rollout of the new functionality.

5.2.  Indicate O-P-S in DNS

   Add a DNS record either containing the outbound-proxy-set or
   indicating that it may safely be derived from the existing SRV
   records.

   This requires no changes to the registrar or edge proxies, and only a
   presumably straightforward DNS update, but the UA will potentially
   need new DNS lookups to change behaviour.  This approach also
   prevents a staged rollout of the functionality since all UAs
   supporting the feature will discover it at the same time.
