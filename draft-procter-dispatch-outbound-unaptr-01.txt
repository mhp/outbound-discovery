       Automatic discovery of RFC 5626 Edge Proxies using U-NAPTR
               draft-procter-dispatch-outbound-unaptr-01

Abstract

   [RFC5626] (commonly known as 'SIP outbound') defines mechanisms that
   permit SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) UAs (User Agents) to
   maintain multiple connections to a registrar or proxy via multiple
   Edge Proxies, known as the outbound-proxy-set.  Discovering the URIs
   that make up the outbound-proxy-set is left to configuration or
   future discovery mechanisms.

   This draft defines a simple discovery mechanism based on U-NAPTR
   [RFC4848] that enables UAs to discover the URIs of all the Edge
   Proxies in the outbound-proxy-set without requiring additional
   configuration on the UA.

1.  Introduction

   Reliably maintaining connectivity between a SIP UA and a registrar
   across the Internet, in the presence of NATs, routing changes, and
   maintenance of intervening equipment is made more straightforward by
   [RFC5626].  The mechanisms in that specification allow multiple
   connections over diverse routes, equipment, and data centres, which
   permit a more robust SIP service to be created.

   However, one of the hurdles that is preventing wide-spread use of
   these mechanisms is discovering the outbound-proxy-set, the list of
   suitable edge proxies that a UA may use for multiple connections.
   Some UAs permit this set to be configured, but the large number of
   options available on many UAs means that configuration for robustness
   is often overlooked once basic operation is possible.

   This draft describes a simple mechanism by which a UA may determine
   the outbound-proxy-set from the DNS.  The choice of U-NAPTR [RFC4848]
   is driven by the desire to directly discover URIs to use as outbound
   proxies, yet also minimise the complexity of the solution by not
   requiring the regular expression processing associated with a full
   NAPTR implementation.

2.1.  Determining the outbound-proxy-set

   When a UA wishes to determine the outbound-proxy-set for a particular
   domain (the domain against which it wishes to register), it submits a
   DNS NAPTR query for that domain.

   For example, when registering against 'sip:example.net', the UA would
   submit a DNS NAPTR query for "example.net", and might receive a
   response contains answers such as:

      NAPTR 100 10 "u" "SIPOUTBOUND" "!^.*$!sips:lon.example.net!" ""
      NAPTR 100 10 "u" "SIPOUTBOUND" "!^.*$!sips:nyc.example.net!" ""
      NAPTR 100 20 "u" "SIPOUTBOUND" "!^.*$!sips:cph.example.net!" ""
      NAPTR 100 30 "u" "SIPOUTBOUND" "!^.*$!sips:sfo.example.net!" ""
      NAPTR  90 50 "s" "SIP+D2T"     ""  _sip._tcp.example.net.
      NAPTR 100 50 "s" "SIP+D2U"     ""  _sip._udp.example.net.


   In this example, four SIP URIs with an application service tag of
   "SIPOUTBOUND" are provided with the same order and varying preference
   values.  A UA may use as many of these as it supports in preference
   order as the outbound-proxy-set.  [RFC5626] requires UAs to support
   at least two and preferably up to four outbound-proxies.

   TODO: should we use both application service and protocol tags, e.g.
   "OUTBOUND:sip" & "OUTBOUND:sips", or just a service tag as shown?

   TODO: Is it worth noting we can only use answers with the same order
   value?  rfc3403 is very clear that you can't consider answers with
   different orders.

   Following the construction of the outbound-proxy-set, the procedures
   in [RFC5626] section 4 may be followed.

2.2.  Maintaining the outbound-proxy-set

   Since the outbound-proxy-set is now determined dynamically, rather
   than through static configuration, care should be taken to respect
   the relevant DNS TTL values and ensure that when the DNS records
   change, the configuration of the outbound-proxy-set and the number
   and destinations of registrations are updated accordingly.

   If the outbound-proxy-set is refreshed and no changes are found, then
   the UA continues to use the flows it has already established.  If it
   has a flow to a proxy that is no longer present in the outbound-
   proxy-set, it should take steps to remove that flow.  Similarly, if
   additional proxies are now available, the UA may choose to establish
   flows to these proxies.
